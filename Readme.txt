Ensure your board type is set to 'Lilypad Arduino' (not 'Lilypad Arduino USB')

The badge uses a LED matrix (4 rows and 6 columns) to show the time in binary.  Button 1 and button 2 are used to set the time on the badge.  The switch is used to turn the lights on and off.  The badge will keep track of time while the lights are off.
